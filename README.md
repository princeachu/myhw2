In this project I designed a about me website that links to two other html files labeled contacts and portfolio. In this project I utilized html and css bootstrap. I also created two external style sheets one for contact and the other for portfolio. 

First I worked on the index file by utilizing bootstrap css for the nav bar creating a link for each of my files. I then created a div class container for my main content. I put a header for my name and under that a professional image of myself with a quick bio underneath it. 

Then I worked on my portfolio page including the same nav page from bootsrap used earlier. I created a porfolio header and a container for my project images, each image was labeled underneath and using the extrenal stylesheet I designed and organized them to my prefrences. 

Finally I designed the contact page using an existing bootstrap layout I edited the code to my own specifications with the same nav bar as stated previously at the top. I then used the external style sheet to edit the content to my own specifications and published all three sites on git hub.
